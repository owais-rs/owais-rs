## Projects

### **SIEM Home-lab**  
> *ðŸ“Œ To be uploaded soon*

**Technologies:** Splunk, Windows, VirtualBox  

- Created a virtualized cybersecurity homelab to simulate real-world network environments with multiple machines, focusing on Blue Team activities.  
- Configured Splunk as a SIEM to centralize and monitor system, application, and network logs from virtual hosts.  
- Performed log analysis to detect suspicious activities, identify indicators of compromise (IoCs), and respond to simulated incidents.  
- Developed custom dashboards and alerts in Splunk to monitor network traffic, detect brute-force attacks, and flag potential threats.

### **Active Directory Home-lab**  
> *ðŸ“Œ To be uploaded soon*

**Technologies:** Windows Server, VirtualBox  

- Set up a virtualized Active Directory environment using Windows Server and VirtualBox, creating an isolated network for testing and learning identity management concepts.  
- Configured and administered domain controllers, managing users, groups, and organizational units (OUs), while setting up and controlling permissions within the virtual domain.  
- Implemented and managed Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to enforce security settings, such as password policies, software restrictions, and user access controls across the network.  
- Simulated real-world identity and access management scenarios, including user authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), resource sharing, and troubleshooting login issues to mimic a corporate environment.

### [**Keylogger Application**](https://github.com/owais-rs/python-keylogger)  
**Technologies:** Python  

- Developed a Python-based keylogger capable of capturing keystrokes, clipboard content, microphone recordings, and screenshots, with functionalities to encrypt the collected data using the Cryptography module (Fernet).  
- Automated system information extraction including device specifications, IP addresses, and public IP using socket and platform libraries.  
- Email integration for data transfer, enabling automated sending of collected logs and screenshots via SMTP to a designated email address.  
- Implemented file encryption and decryption mechanisms for securing log data before sending it and included functionality for log cleanup post data collection to maintain privacy.
